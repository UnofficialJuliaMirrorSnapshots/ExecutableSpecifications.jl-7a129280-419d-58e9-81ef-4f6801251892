BDD is an acronym for _Behaviour Driven Development_. It is a process for creating and verifying
requirements, written in such a way that they can be executed as code. This package aims to be a
tool for executing such requirements, and creating reports.

This package is in the early stages of development, and has only minimal functionality.

# Usage
Specifications are written in the Gherkin format, such as

```gherkin
Feature: Making coffee

    Scenario: Making a cup of coffee
        Given that there is a cup in the coffee machine
         When the "Coffee" button is pressed
         Then the cup is filled with coffee
```

For each `Given`, `When`, and `Then` line, a corresponding method is written, which is executed when
that line is reached.

```julia
using ExecutableSpecifications
using CoffeeMachine

hascoffee(cup::Cup) = cup[:coffee] > 0.0

@given "that there is a cup in the coffee machine" begin
    cup = Cup()
    machine = Machine()

    cupisinthemachine(machine, cup)

    context[:cup] = cup
    context[:machine] = machine
end

@when "the \"Coffee\" button is pressed" begin
    machine = context[:machine]
    coffeewaspressed(machine)
end

@then "the cup is filled with coffee" begin
    cup = context[:cup]
    @expect hascoffee(cup)
end
```

Feature files have extension `.feature`, and are stored in the `features` directory (see
"Current state" for current limitations), and step definitions (the executable code) have the
extension `.jl` and are stored in `features/steps`.

# Example project
The project [CoffeeMachine.jl](https://github.com/erikedin/CoffeeMachine.jl) is an example of how to
use ExecutableSpecifications.jl.

# Running
Run the command line tool `runspec.jl` from the directory containing the `features` directory, or
from the Julia REPL with

```julia
julia> using ExecutableSpecifications
julia> runspec()
```

See "Current state" for limitations.

# Julia 0.7 and 0.6
The master branch for this package is now for Julia 0.7. All development will be for 0.7 going
forward.

If you require this package for Julia 0.6, there is a branch `julia-release-0.6`. This is behind
in features, and will only be updated on demand.

# Current state
The package has minimal functionality, but is under active development.

These are some current limitations, that will be lifted as development progresses:

- Reads feature and step definition files from a single hardcoded directory.

    Today only the directory `features` is searched for feature files. Step files are only read from
    `features/steps/*.jl`. Going forward, all feature files and all step files will be read of
    course.

- Presenting the results of scenarios is very rudimentary.
- No setup or teardown functions.
- No variables in step definition strings

    One would like to be able to define a variable in a step definition like
    `@given "some value {foo}" begin`. Without this, scenario outlines may become difficult to use,
    since you have to define a separate step definition for each value used in the outline.
